        <h3>Research question</h3>
        <p>The overall question I was curious in was what factors contribute
          to happiness in the world so I chose interesting questions which I
          thought could affect happiness such as religion, family, trust in
          people etc.</p>
        <h3>Data transformation</h3>
        <p>The data had to be transformed into some form that would be easier
          to analyse. In some questions from WVS I had to choose the answer
          which yielded the clearest answer such as “unemployed” or “immigration
          prohibition”. The other answers were different scales of “yes” you
          could say and therefore I took the “hard” no answers. From the
          “Happiness” and “Trust in Press” questionnaires I summed up all
          positive answers to get a somewhat “hard” yes.</p>

        <h3>Visual mapping</h3>
        <p>My first thought of visual model to use for 8 variables data was a
          parallel coordinate system. I think that is a good way to visualize
          and compare different data points with that many dimensions.</p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>The most interesting results was that I couldn’t see any correlation
          between life satisfaction and happiness or happiness and religion which
          I thought would have been correlated with each other.</p>
        <img src="images/Result.png">
        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <p>In this project I got to learn D3.js better and I understand now how
          you are supposed to work with it codewise. I didn’t have that much
          experience with web programming and with this project I have also been
          practicing those skills.
          But the biggest learning outcome for me I think was using the
          information visualization pipeline in practice.</p>
