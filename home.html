        <h3>Research question</h3>
        <p>The overall question I was curious in was what factors contribute
          to happiness in the world and how it has changed over time. So I
          chose interesting questions which I thought could affect happiness
          such as religion, family, trust in people etc.</p>

        <div class="well">
          <h2>Analytic trail 1</p>
          <h3>Data transformation</h3>
          <p>The data had to be transformed into some form that would be easier
            to analyse. In some questions from WVS I had to choose the answer
            which yielded the clearest answer such as “immigration
            prohibition” instead of "Let anyone come" and "Let some came". The
            other answers you could say were different scales of “yes” and
            therefore I took the “hard” no answers. From the “Happiness” and
            “Trust in Press” questionnaires I summed up all positive answers to
            get a somewhat “hard” yes. Time is represented by different charts.</p>

          <img src="images/TrustPress.PNG">
          <h3>Visual transformation</h3>
          <p>My first thought of visual model to use for the 8 variable data was a
            parallel coordinate system. I thought that it would be a good way to
            visualize and compare different data points with that many dimensions.</p>
          <h3>Result</h3>
          <p>The most interesting results from this visualization was that I
            couldn’t see any correlation between life satisfaction and happiness
            or happiness and religion which I thought would have been strongly
            correlated with each other.</p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="well">
          <h2>Analytic trail 2</p>
          <h3>Data transformation</h3>
          <p>To be able to compare different time intervals I divided the data in
            to different charts with data from that particular time period.</p>
          <img src="images/TimeCharts.PNG">
          <h3>Visual transformation</h3>
          <p>A chose to visualize a timeline where each point is a chart with
            data corresponding to that time period.</p>
          <!-- <img align="middle" src="images/TimeScale.PNG"> -->
          <h3>Result</h3>
          <p>What I can interpret comparing the overall combined happiness from
            all countries is that more people has become happier since 1995-1999.</p>

        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <p>In this project I got to learn D3.js better and I understand now how
          you are supposed to work with it codewise. I didn’t have that much
          experience with web programming and with this project I have also been
          practicing those skills. But the biggest learning experience for me I
          think was working wih the information visualization pipeline in practice.</p>
